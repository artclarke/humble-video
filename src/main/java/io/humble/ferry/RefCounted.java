/**
 * Parent of all Ferry objects -- it mains reference counts  
 * in native code.  
 * <p>  
 * RefCounted objects cannot be made with new. They must be  
 * constructed with special factory methods, usually called  
 * make(...).  
 * </p>  
 * <h2>Special note for developers in languages other than C++</h2> 
 *  
 * <p>  
 * You should not need to worry about this class very much. Feel  
 * free to ignore it.  
 * </p>  
 * <h2>Special note for C++ Users</h2>  
 * <p>  
 * Users of RefCounted objects in Native (C++) code must make  
 * sure they acquire() a reference to an object if they  
 * intend to keep using it after they have returned from  
 * the method it was passed to, and  
 * must call release() when done to ensure memory is freed.  
 * </p>  
 * <p>  
 * Methods that return RefCounted objects on the stack are  
 * expected to acquire() the reference for the caller, and  
 * callers <b>must</b> release() any RefCounted object  
 * returned on the stack.  
 * <p>  
 * For example:  
 * </p>  
 * <code>  
 * <pre>  
 * RefCounted methodReturningRefCountedObject();  
 * {  
 * mValueToReturn->acquire(); acquire for caller  
 * return mValueToReturn; and return  
 * }  
 * {  
 * RefCounted *value = methodReturningRefCountedObject();  
 * ...  
 * caller must release  
 * if (value)  
 * value->release();  
 * }  
 * </pre>  
 * </code>
