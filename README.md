# How To Use In Your Code

## Maven projects

If using Maven, Humble is deployed to the Maven Central Repository. To include it in your project (note: this will include artifacts for all operating systems), add this to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<project>
  ...
  <dependencies>
    ...
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.humble</groupId>
      <artifactId>humble-video-all</artifactId>
      <version>0.3.0</version>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
</project>
```

## Gradle projects

If using Gradle, you can easily use Humble from Maven Central Repository. To include it in your project (note: this will include artifacts for all operating systems), add this to your `build.gradle`:

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'io.humble:humble-video-all:0.3.0'
}
```

# Demoes of the API in action.

To see how to use the API, go to the [humble-video-demos](humble-video-demos/) package.

# Supported Platforms

Humble Video's Maven Central artifacts contain native (i.e. non-Java) code and are tests to run on the following platforms:


| Operating System | Architecture |
| ------ | ------------------- |
| Microsoft Windows XP or later | i686 and x86_64 intel processors |
| Apple OS X | x86_64 intel processors |
| Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and later | i686 and x86_64 intel processors |

If you are running on other platforms, the Maven Central artifacts may not work and you'll have to build your own version. And beware ... building Humble takes a very long time.

# Building Humble Video

## Please read this BEFORE running 'mvn install'.

Welcome to the Humble Video uber project.

HumbleVideo allows Java Virtual Machine developers (Java, Scala, Clojure, JRuby, etc.) to decode, analyze/modify
and encode audio and video data into 100s of different formats (e.g. H264, AAC, MP3, FLV, etc.). It uses the
<a href="http://ffmpeg.org">FFmpeg</a> project under the covers.

Humble Video is a mix of Java and native code, and the native code is written in C++, C and Assembly. Most users
are **strongly** encouraged to use the maven artifacts in a central repository, as building the system is complicated.
It requires accesss to a Mac OS X development environment (Mountain Lion or later).

It consists of several sub-projects which are detailed below:

* `humble-video-parent/`: The parent pom to all projects, where global defaults (like version numbers) are set.
* `humble-video-chef/`: A collection of chef-solo recipes for configuring a Vagrant Ubuntu-64-bit box to build Linux and Windows versions.
* `humble-video-captive/`: All open-source libraries incorporated into humble-video. These are built with a custom build system.
* `humble-video-native/`: All native (C/C++/Assembly) code for Humble-Video. These are built with a custom build system that generates
     many Maven artifacts containing native code. and generate Java files. The maven artifacts generated are of the form:
     `humble-video-arch-${architecture-specifier}.jar` and the architecture-specifier looks like `i686-gnu-linux` for 32-bit linux, etc.
     For users who do not want to always download artifacts that contain all architectures, these are valid POMs to be depended on.
  that are inserted into `humble-video-all`.
* `humble-video-noarch/`: All Java code (and only Java code), including some generated Java code from `humble-video-native`. Unit tests run from here.  These are built with maven. 
* `humble-video-test/`: All integration (very long running) tests for humble-video. Depends on humble-video-noarch and (via maven profiles) whatever architecture specific versions of the native code Jars it needs.
* `humble-video-demos/`: A series of demo programs showing the Humble API in action.
* `humble-video-all/`: A pom that depends on humble-video-noarch and humble-video-arch-all. This will only successfully build on build machines that have all architecture files required staged (i.e. probably not your box).
* `humble-video-stage/`: Where all the native code's final artifacts (DLLs and the like) end up being place so that all the rest of the maven build system knows where to find them

To build, assuming you have all the prerequisites installed for your OS (see below), run:

    mvn install

To clean out a build tree, you need to do:

    (cd humble-video-stage && mvn clean) && mvn clean

That will clean out all the staged binaries in addition to the intermediate files built for each operating system.

# Pre-requisites on build machines

This project builds native code that can be used for Humble Software, and
also generates Java files that can be compiled into Maven libraries
that use the native code.

To build the native code the autotools stack is required:

* GNU c++ compilers
* autotool (autoreconf, automake, autoconf, etc.)
* YASM and NASM (for assembly)
* pkg-config
* The Humble-Swig version of Swig (Use https://github.com/artclarke/humble-swig to get JavaDoc generated).
* Doxygen & DOT (for C++ documentation)
* Valgrind (for auto memory leak detection -- try 'make memcheck')
* Java JDK 1.6 or higher

## Mac OS X Notes

Mac OS X is the preferred environment for building Humble Video because it allows you
to build all supported environments (Mac, Linux and Darwin) if you install Oracle's
VirtualBox software and the excellent [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) program.

You must install the JDK on your mac, and also Apple's xCode developer tools.

The 'brew' utility is your on Mac OS X friend. Use it often. You can install yasm using that.

    brew install pkg-config
    brew install yasm
    brew install nasm
    brew install valgrind

To install the Humble-Swig version of Swig:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:artclarke/humble-swig.git
cd humble-swig
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
make install
```

Also, on Mac OS X the Valgrind test suite only works for 64-bit builds.

To cross-compile for linux and windows in addition to Mac OS X, run:

    # On your Mac OS X terminal
    mvn install
    vagrant up

    # Once your vagrant box is provisioned
    vagrant ssh

    # From the Vagrant shell
    cd /vagrant
    mvn install

## Linux Build Notes

You need to make sure the Chef recipes that are in `./Vagrantfile` get installed on your Linux box. Those recipes are in the humble-video-chef project. 

I've only tested on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, so that's all that supported to build on, and it's a work in progress so hang tight..

To build, once the chef recipes have run on a clean box, just run:

    mvn install

## Windows Build Notes
Don't do it. It's not supported. Instead you have to cross-compile for Windows from a Linux box. Sorry.

# Steps Required To Release.

Release is a long process. The builds take hours on a 2012 MacBook Pro. You really want to be highly confident before you kick it off.

That said, I've attempted to automate as much of it as possible. The biggest challenge is patience.

All steps should be done from a OS X machine, and we'll build the other binaries in the Vagrant VM running on that OS X machine.

1. Start a git flow release

```bash
git flow release start v<version-number>
```

2. Publish that release branch

```bash
git push origin release/v<version-number>
```

3. **Checkout a branch new copy of the repository -- no cheating**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:artclarke/humble-video.git humble-video-v<version-number>
```

4. Start up the VM that will build the linux/windows stuff.

```bash
cd humble-video-v<version-number>
vagrant up
```

5. Wait a long time for it to download and provision itself (can be safely done in parallel with 6).

6. Do a full Mac build and test (can be safely done in parallel with 5). Note that we have to build the native code 4 times for each operating system (x86_64 and i686 versions / debug and release versions), so this takes a long time.

```bash
mvn install 2>&1 | tee mvn.out
```

7. If both 5 and 6 completed successfully, build and run on Linux. This is the longest single step -- takes about 3 hours on my MacBook pro. Grab coffee.

```bash
vagrant ssh --command "cd /vagrant && mvn install 2>&1 | tee mvn-linux.out"
```


8. If successful, you now have binaries for all supported OSes staged in the humble-video-stage directory. Well done. Now let's test deploying a snapshot.

```bash
mvn -P\!build,deploy deploy 2>&1 | tee mvn.out
```

Note: to do all of those (steps 4 through 8):

```bash
vagrant up && mvn install && vagrant ssh --command "cd /vagrant && mvn install" && mvn -P\!build,deploy deploy 2>&1 | tee mvn.out
```
  
9. If successful, it's time to PEG the snapshots to a specific release. Now things get hairy.

Edit humble-video-parent/pom.xml BY HAND to set the humble.version
```bash
cd humble-video-parent && mvn -Pdeploy versions:set -DnewVersion=<version-number>
```
10. Now, rebuild all Java Source

```bash
(cd humble-video-noarch && mvn clean) && (cd humble-video-test && mvn clean) && (cd humble-video-demos && mvn clean)
```

11. Do one last rebuild (you do not need to rebuild native sources) and deploy

```bash
vagrant up && mvn install && vagrant ssh --command "cd /vagrant && mvn install" && mvn -P\!build,deploy deploy 2>&1 | tee mvn.out
```

12. Check the OSS snapshot page to see if we got deployed correctly:

    https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/io/humble/

13. Make sure it was done correctly by deleting all your m2 artifacts, and forcing a redownload.

```bash
rm -rf $HOME/.m2/repository/io/humble/humble-video-*
(cd humble-video-tests && mvn test)
(cd humble-video-demos && mvn test)
```

14. Merge your changes back into Develop

```bash
git flow release finish v<version-number>
```

15. Peg your develop tree to the next snapshot.

Edit humble-video-parent/pom.xml BY HAND to set the humble.version
```bash
cd humble-video-parent && mvn -Pdeploy versions:set -DnewVersion=<version-number>-SNAPSHOT
cd humble-video-native/src/main/gnu
<edit configure.ac to update version numbers in an editor of your choice>
vagrant ssh --command "cd /vagrant/humble-video-native/src/main/gnu && autoreconf"
```

16. Done!

Enjoy!
